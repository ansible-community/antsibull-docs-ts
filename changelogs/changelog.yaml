      breaking_changes:
      - The package was renamed on npmjs.com from ``antsibull_docs`` to ``antsibull-docs``
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-ts/pull/15).
      bugfixes:
      - Fix error message output for MarkDown. Make sure error message is escaped
        in RST. Fix error messages when parsing escaped parameters (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-ts/pull/8).
      - The ``parse()`` option ``errors``'s default was ``exception``, and not ``message``
        as documented. The default is now ``message`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-ts/pull/6).
      minor_changes:
      - Add support for semantic markup (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-ts/pull/1).
      - Added MarkDown support (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-ts/pull/5).
      - Allow to adjust formatting for HTML, RST, and MarkDown output by allowing
        to provide formatting functions for every part type (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-ts/pull/12).
      - Allow to chose between antsibull-docs like formatting (for Sphinx targets)
        and plain formatting for HTML (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-ts/pull/12).
      - Build both ESM and CommonJS modules for easier consumption in both webpack
        and node.js projects (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-ts/pull/14).
      - Mention paragraph number in error messages when not processing single strings
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-ts/pull/11).
